    <string name="q_1">Q.What is DevJams?</string>
    <string name="a_1">DevJams is an annual 36-hour long hackathon, that aims to bring together great developers and designers under one roof and pitting them against each other in a healthy competition. Under focused mentorship from a dedicated and experienced technical team, and an equally challenging and innovative panel of themes, participants can test their skills and use them to build projects to solve real-world problems.</string>

    <string name="q_2">Q.How do I submit what I have made for the hackathon?</string>
    <string name="a_2">You have to develop the application on your local system, add your code to a GitHub repository and submit its link. Also, you have to update the README of your repository with all the details about your application along with the instructions to run.</string>

    <string name="q_3">Q.Do we need to have the entire idea fully working?</string>
    <string name="a_3">The entire idea need not be fully implemented. However, the submission should be functional so that it can be reviewed by the judges.</string>

    <string name="q_4">Q.Do I need to give a demo of the product that I have built?</string>
    <string name="a_4">If you want, you can submit a small presentation or a video that demonstrates your submission. However, it\'s not mandatory, and only good to have. In case you are one of the winners, you might be invited to demonstrate your application, details of which will be shared with sufficient advance notice.</string>
